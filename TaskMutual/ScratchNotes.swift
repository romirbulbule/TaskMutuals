/* It seems that where we have stopped for now there are quite a few bugs but I am taking a break before i work further on this for the same of my mental health. The bug is that after I log in, it asks me for my first name and last name and to pick out a unique username. In those pages first of all, they do not match the application user interface. Second, it should not ask you to set up your profile like this when you login. It should be a one time setup that happens only after a user signs up, not logs in. The first things that should happen when you open the application should still be ths splash page first, then the login/signup page. Only after a new user has finished their sign in page should the application ask the user first and last name and unique username for user profile setup. */
